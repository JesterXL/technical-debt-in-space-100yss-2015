If AI is shipped, and it’s the first, then you can use it to decrypt RSA for secret messages, etc. since it’s vulnerable to it.

The Blue Brain project has a sub-set that is about reconstructing a rat brain in a computer. Also covers neuromorphic computing. One interesting concept is wiring these computers to a robot, then introducing distortions, then replaying the result, much like Clojure. In doing so, you can get a hint as to what makes Autism tick. IMPORTANT to make a correleary that while the human genome project lead to more questions, and less answers about solving disease, the brain project might have the same end.
